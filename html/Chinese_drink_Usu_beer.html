                    <h3>Usu beer also called the big Usu</h3>
                    <p>
                        The big Usu is a different name for Xinjiang Wusu beer. If it is called "Ukrainian beer" according to the name of the Shandong people, the Zabayi (alcoholic) in Xinjiang is bold and arrogant. Su, it shows the extent to which Xinjiang people love it. As for some people call it "Wusu oral liquid", for the time being. Beer brewing materials are different. Beer made with local ingredients may be more suitable for local people to drink, so Xinjiang people prefer to drink Usu beer. Why do you call it a big Wusu? This should be related to the language characteristics of Xinjiang people. I remember that at the beginning of this century, a restaurant in Urumqi launched a new soup rice, named Yuye Mushroom Soup Rice, which is made with wild mushrooms from the Bayinbulak Prairie. It has a fresh taste and excellent taste, which is good for hangover, many people. After eating it, I frequented it. I felt sorry for the occasional lack of food. The guests called it "the killing of soup rice". If they didn't take it, they would feel uncomfortable and express their love with antisense. Xinjiang people drink beer, and few of them are blowing against the bottle. This is only seen in the beer competition venue in Wusu City. The average person is taking a few notes (the meaning of the bundle), pouring the beer into a large teacup and drinking it. The drink is happy. Several people can squat for one night, and the beer bottles are piled up. Drinking is to be drunk, and if you drink a half, you are really guilty of Zabayi, or you can drink enough. Moller (otherwise) doesn’t touch it. If you don’t drink enough, they will go to another one to drink. The scene continued to be completed until the time of the child's arrival. He had to go home to disband himself. On the way home, he would give a soup rice to sober up, so that he would not find the north. Xinjiang people drink so much, and many Zabayi drink like a life. If you don't drink, you don't have life. If you don't drink, you don't have friends. If you don't drink, you will be blind, and you don't drink your head like a broken one. Beer life, don't drink really bad!</p>
